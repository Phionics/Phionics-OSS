Phionics is an experimental "geo-relational coherence membrane" for multi-agent AI proposal generation and fusion.

Generate diverse candidates → measure informational curvature κ → adaptively weight via n-Nacci recurrence & minority-signal preservation → aggregate a coherent, ethically-aware output.

This repo is a minimal, runnable open-source starter with:
- Pure NumPy reference implementation (deterministic, no LLM calls)
- LangChain integration for plugging in real LLMs/embedders
- Toy demos & ethical profiles

Run a quick example: `python examples/01_minimal.py`
